    <h1>Privacy Policy for JumushBar</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: 2025/Aug/18</p>

    <div class="apology">
      <strong>Note and apology:</strong>
      <p>During development we included random test posts (images and placeholder text) to exercise UI and upload flows. These test items were not intended for public use and have now been removed. We apologize for any confusion or harm this caused and have updated our content moderation and upload safeguards to prevent test content from being published in production.</p>
    </div>

    <p>JumushBar provides a platform to connect employees and employers. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use and protect it, and your rights. If you have questions, contact us at <strong>devstudiokg@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Platform review note</h2>
    <p>JumushBar has been reviewed and accepted on the Apple App Store. We include this to indicate the app has passed a separate platform review; we understand Google Play conducts an independent evaluation.</p>

    <h2>1. What information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, surname, email address, phone number, password (hashed), and profile information you provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification documents (employees only):</strong> government-issued ID front and back images and a selfie holding the ID (used for identity verification).</li>
      <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> profession/category, skills, availability.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app analytics, logs, crash reports, and device information (device model, OS version, IP address) required to operate and improve the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> messages between users and support requests (content you send to us).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purpose & legal basis</h2>
    <p>We collect and process personal data for these purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To create and manage user accounts and enable login (contractual necessity).</li>
      <li>To verify identity and reduce fraud and illegal behavior by employees (legitimate interest and user consent where applicable).</li>
      <li>To deliver the service, manage profiles and match users (contractual necessity / legitimate interest).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests.</li>
      <li>To analyze and improve the app and for security monitoring (legitimate interest).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why we collect government ID and selfie</h2>
    <p>Employees are asked to upload a government ID (front and back) and a selfie holding the ID so we can verify identity and help protect employers and users from potential illegal activity or misrepresentation. Verification is mandatory for employee accounts that offer services where identity verification is necessary for safety and trust.</p>

    <h2>4. How we store and protect your data</h2>
    <p>Verification documents and personal data are stored securely. We implement technical and organizational measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and audit logs to limit access to authorized staff only. Only personnel who need access for verification or legal compliance can view verification documents.</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain verification documents and personal information only as long as necessary for the purpose collected, generally for verification and fraud-prevention purposes. Typical retention periods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Active account data: while account is active.</li>
      <li>Verification documents: up to 90 days after verification is complete, unless retention is required by law or a safety investigation requires longer retention; in such cases we will only retain what is strictly necessary.</li>
      <li>Support and communications: up to 1 year unless needed longer for legal reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third-party service providers (e.g., secure storage, identity verification services, analytics) who process data on our behalf and under contract.</li>
      <li>Law enforcement or government agencies when required by law or to respond to lawful requests.</li>
      <li>Other users: basic profile information that you choose to make public for matching purposes (profession, name as shown in profile).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, portability, and to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at <strong>devstudiokg@gmail.com</strong>. We will respond to verified requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for children under 13 (or applicable local age). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable age. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us and we will remove it as required by law.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures. However, no internet transmission is completely secure. If you suspect a security issue, contact us immediately at <strong>devstudiokg@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

    <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
    <p>We may transfer data to servers or service providers located in other countries. When we do so, we use safeguards required by law (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. We will post the updated date at the top of this page.</p>
